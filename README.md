My name is Andrej «suVrik» Suvoraŭ. I am a game developer from Minsk, Belarus. Making games was my passion for as long as I can remember. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKov7u1D5Z0) to see a video compilation of some of the indie games I made.

Since 2018 I worked at Press Fire Games on Battle Prime and another unannounced project. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKov7u1D5Z0) to see a Battle Prime promo.
