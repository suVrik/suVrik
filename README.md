Making games was my passion for as long as I can remember. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKov7u1D5Z0) to see a video compilation of some of the indie games I made.

In 2018 I worked a few months in [Wargaming](https://wargaming.com/en/) on [World of Tanks Blitz](https://wotblitz.com/) game engine and another unannounced project.

Since 2018 I worked at [Press Fire Games](https://www.pressfire.games/) on [Battle Prime](https://www.battleprime.com/) and another unannounced project. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKov7u1D5Z0) to see a Battle Prime video.

Original Projects:
* KURWA;
* [Acceleration Structure Research](https://github.com/suVrik/acceleration_structure_benchmark) — research I've done for acceleration structures in KURWA;
* [Particle System Research](https://github.com/suVrik/particle_system_benchmark) — research I've done for particle systems in KURWA;
* [Filesystem Research](https://github.com/suVrik/steaming_benchmark) — research I've done for texture streaming in KURWA;
* [Hooker Galore](https://github.com/suVrik/hooker.galore) — an experimental game engine in which everything works through ECS;
* [Texture Compiler](https://github.com/suVrik/texture.compiler) — texture converter for Hooker Galore. Custom format/mipmap strategies for different types of textures;
* [You Broke The Game](https://github.com/suVrik/ld45) — Ludum Dare 45 submission made together with [Oleg Klishin](https://olegklishin.portfoliobox.net/). Play [here](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/740567);
* [Untitled Platformer](https://github.com/suVrik/ld47) — Ludum Dare 47 attempt made together with [Oleg Klishin](https://olegklishin.portfoliobox.net/). We were not satisfied with the result, so we didn't finish it. You can find screenshot and a play link in the repo;
* [Ghostlunky](https://github.com/suVrik/ghostlunky) — a tool that allows you to play [Spelunky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239350/Spelunky/) on custom seed. Another reverse engineering feature I'm proud of is "Enable own camera" for [Frozlunky](https://github.com/sashavol/Frozlunky);
* [Path Tracer](https://github.com/suVrik/path_tracer) — a path tracer insipired by [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents);
* [Software Rasterizer](https://github.com/suVrik/software_rasterizer) — software rasterization studies;
* [AABBox Layout Research](https://github.com/suVrik/aabbox_benchmark) — research on which AABBox layout is more optimal: min/max or center/extent;
* [Allocators](https://github.com/suVrik/allocator_benchmark) — benchmark of malloc, buddy and pool allocators;
* [Codeforces](https://github.com/suVrik/codeforces) — some data structures and algorithms I use for competitive programming.

These are the projects I've done in my spare time only in the past 2 years.
